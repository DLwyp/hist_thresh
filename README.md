[A Generalization of Otsu's Method and Minimum Error Thresholding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07350),
Jonathan T. Barron, ECCV, 2020

Running `experiments.ipynb` should exactly reproduce the figures and tables shown in the paper.

Run `interactive_viewer.ipynb` if you want to play with algorithm parameters on an arbitrary image. You can do this in your browser, just click on the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the notebook.

An R implementation (graciously contributed by [slowkow](https://github.com/slowkow)) can be found in `ght.R`.
